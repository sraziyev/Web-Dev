HTML Validators
Question 1 of 2
Using the W3C HTML Validator(opens in a new tab), what happens when you enter the following HTML into the "validate by input" text box:
The validator found errors or warnings in the HTML
The validator assumed the document was something other than HTML5

Question 2 of 2
Now, modify the HTML you entered previously so it follows the HTML template. Make sure to set doctype for HTML5!
What is the message displayed once the validator successfully validates your code?

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Validation Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a title</h1>
    </body>
</html>

Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.
