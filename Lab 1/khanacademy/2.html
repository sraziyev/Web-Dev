            Nobody’s <strong>born smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first</em>.<br>
            There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
            And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
            Thankfully, we are <em>born to learn</em>.<br>
            <em>Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            <strong>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</strong><br>
            Until one day, you walk.<br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
            <em>Failing is just another word for growing</em>. And you keep going.<br>
            <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
            You just don’t get it, <strong>yet</strong>.
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
            <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are</em>.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            You only have to know one thing:<br>
            <strong>You can learn anything</strong>.
