        Nobody’s <strong>born smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first</em>.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are <em>born to learn</em>.<br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <strong>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</strong><br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <em>Failing is just another word for growing</em>. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <strong>yet</strong>.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are</em>.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything</strong>.

<!--A "blog" (or "web log") is an online journal, which one or multiple people update on a frequent basis, like daily, weekly, or monthly. Many new programmers keep blogs to document their journey to becoming a programmer, with updates on what they've learned and what they've made.

There are many "blogging engines" out there, like WordPress and Blogger, but in this project, you'll make your own blog using HTML and CSS. It should have at least 2 entries, and the table of contents should internally link to each entry. Use CSS text properties to style your blog - like changing the font family, line height, and font styles of various sections.

If you like your blog, then you could use it to document your journey here - make it a featured project on your profile, then people that visit your profile will get to read about your journey!-->

                <p>The <strong>ocean</strong> is the connected body of salty water that covers 70.8% of the Earth's surface. The sea moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into four or five large sections, such as the Pacific, called oceans while smaller sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as seas.
                </p>
                <p>
        Owing to the present state of continental drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium and chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).

            <h5>Why are some clouds yellow?</h5>
            <p>Yellowish clouds may occur in the late spring through early fall months during forest fire season. The yellow color is due to the presence of pollutants in the smoke. Yellowish clouds caused by the presence of nitrogen dioxide are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels.

        <p>In meteorology, a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as aerosols and are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.</p>

        <p>Terrestrial cloud formation is the result of air in Earth's atmosphere becoming saturated due to either or both of two processes: cooling of the air and adding water vapor. With sufficient saturation, precipitation will fall to the surface.</p>

<!--In this project, you'll make an event invite for an event- a party, a workshop, a wedding, whatever you want. It should have event title, details, and maybe it'd have a guest list or RSVP button.

Before you start coding, I encourage you to "prototype" it - to plan it out either on paper or with a "prototyping" tool. Sketch out the vision you have in your head and go through a few prototypes until you're happy.

Then, when you're ready, try to implement your event invite in HTML/CSS. If you get stuck on something that's hard to transfer from paper to HTML, try searching on the internet or clicking "Request Help." I bet you'll learn something from the process.-->
